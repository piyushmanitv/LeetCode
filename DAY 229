837. New 21 Game


Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer
number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the 
outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.
