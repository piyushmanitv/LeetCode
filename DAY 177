2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K


You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:

The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '0') zeros++;
        }

            if (s[i] == '1') {
                if (value + pow > k) {
