Solved

You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile













int mod = 1e9+7;
class Solution {
public:
    int numTilings(int n) {
        vector<int>v = {1, 1, 2};
        if(n < 3) return v[n];
        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++){
            long long x = (2LL*v[2] + v[0])%mod;
            v = {v[1], v[2], (int)x};
        }
        return v[2];
    }
};
