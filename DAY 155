3403. Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I


You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
All the split words are put into a box.
Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.










class Solution {
 public:
  string answerString(string word, int numFriends) {
    if (numFriends == 1)
      return word;
    const string s = lastSubstring(word);
    const size_t sz = word.length() - numFriends + 1;
    return s.substr(0, min(s.length(), sz));
  }
 private:
  string lastSubstring(string s) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 1;
    int k = 0;

    while (j + k < s.length())
      if (s[i + k] == s[j + k]) {
        ++k;
      } else if (s[i + k] > s[j + k]) {
        j = j + k + 1;
        k = 0;
      } else {
        i = max(i + k + 1, j);
        j = i + 1;
        k = 0;
      }

    return s.substr(i);
  }
};
