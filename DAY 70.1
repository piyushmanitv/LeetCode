392. Is Subsequence



Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by
deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions
of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).









class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int n = s.length(); 
        int m = t.length(); 
        int j = 0; 
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (j < n && t[i] == s[j]) { 
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j == n;
    }
};
