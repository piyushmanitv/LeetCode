1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced

You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

public:
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        int bCount = 0;    
        int deletions = 0; 

        for(char c : s) {
            if(c == 'b') {
                bCount++;
            } else { 
                if(bCount > 0) {
                    deletions++;
                    bCount--;   
                }
            }
