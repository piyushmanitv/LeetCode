151. Reverse Words in a String






Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will 
be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between
two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the
words. Do not include any extra spaces.









class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
        int n=s.size();
        int left=0;
        int right=0;
        int i=0;
        while(i<n){
            while(i<n && s[i]==' ')i++;
            if(i==n)break; 
            while(i<n && s[i]!=' '){
                s[right++]=s[i++];
            }
            reverse(s.begin()+left,s.begin()+right);
            s[right++]=' ';
            left=right;
            i++;
        }
        s.resize(right-1);
        return s;
    }
};
