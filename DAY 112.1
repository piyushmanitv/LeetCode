Q2. Make Array Non-decreasing
Medium
4 pt.
You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can select a subarray and replace it with a single element equal to its maximum value.

Return the maximum possible size of the array after performing zero or more operations such that the resulting array is non-decreasing.











 class Solution {
public:
    int maximumPossibleSize(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> stack;
        for (int num : nums) {
            while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() > num) {
                num = max(num, stack.back());
                stack.pop_back();
            }
            stack.push_back(num);
        }
        return stack.size();
    }
};
