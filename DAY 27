1462. Course Schedule IV






There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1.
You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you 
must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.

For example, the pair [0, 1] indicates that you have to take course 0 before you can take 
course 1.
Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b 
is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.

You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you 
should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.

Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.
