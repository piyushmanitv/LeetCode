Hint
Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.










class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7; 
        vector<int> dp(high + 1, 0); 
        dp[0] = 1; 
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= high; ++i) {
            if (i >= zero) dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % MOD;
            if (i >= one) dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % MOD;
            if (i >= low) result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
