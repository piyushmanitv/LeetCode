1143. Longest Common Subsequence






Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length
of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with 
some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.








class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        vector<int> dp(text1.length(), 0);
        int longest = 0;

        for (char c : text2) {
            int curLength = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < dp.size(); i++) {
                if (curLength < dp[i]) {
                    curLength = dp[i];
                } else if (c == text1[i]) {
                    dp[i] = curLength + 1;
                    longest = max(longest, curLength + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return longest;        
    }
};
