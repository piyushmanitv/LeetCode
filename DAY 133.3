Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.








class Solution {
public:
    int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                dp[j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[j], j > 0 ? dp[j - 1] : INT_MAX);
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
};
