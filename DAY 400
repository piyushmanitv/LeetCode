1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.









class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (k == 1) return 0; 

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            int diff = nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i];
            minDiff = min(minDiff, diff);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
};
