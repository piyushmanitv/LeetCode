3606. Coupon Code Validator


You are given three arrays of length n that describe the properties of n coupons: code, businessLine, and isActive. The ith coupon has:

code[i]: a string representing the coupon identifier.
businessLine[i]: a string denoting the business category of the coupon.
isActive[i]: a boolean indicating whether the coupon is currently active.
A coupon is considered valid if all of the following conditions hold:

code[i] is non-empty and consists only of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (_).
businessLine[i] is one of the following four categories: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant".
isActive[i] is true.
Return an array of the codes of all valid coupons, sorted first by their businessLine in the 
order: "electronics", "grocery", "pharmacy", "restaurant", and then by code in lexicographical (ascending) order within each category.
