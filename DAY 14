Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays










You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations A and B of length n.

A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.

Return the prefix common array of A and B.

A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.

        int c=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(++freq[A[i]]==2)c++;
            if(++freq[B[i]]==2)c++;
            res.push_back(c);
