Minimum Length of String After Operations




You are given a string s.

You can perform the following process on s any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.










class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        int res=0;
        unordered_map<char,int> m;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++)m[s[i]]++;
        for(auto c:m) c.second%2==0?res+=2:res+=1;
        return res;
    }
};
