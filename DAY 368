1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid

You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.












class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        long same = 6;
        long diff = 6;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            long newSame = (same * 3 + diff * 2) % MOD;
            long newDiff = (same * 2 + diff * 2) % MOD;

            same = newSame;
            diff = newDiff;
        }

        return (same + diff) % MOD;
    }
};
