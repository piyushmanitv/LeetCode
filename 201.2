Solved
Easy
3 pt.
You are given a positive integer n. Determine whether n is divisible by the sum of the following two values:

The digit sum of n (the sum of its digits).

The digit product of n (the product of its digits).

Return true if n is divisible by this sum; otherwise, return false.©leetcode









class Solution {
public:
    bool checkDivisibility(int n) {
        int original = n;
        int digitSum = 0, digitProduct = 1;

        while (n > 0) {
            int d = n % 10;
            digitSum += d;
            digitProduct *= d;
            n /= 10;
        }

        int total = digitSum + digitProduct;
        return original % total == 0;
    }
