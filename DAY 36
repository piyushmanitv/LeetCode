1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal




  
You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length.
  A string swap is an operation where you choose two 
  indices in a string (not necessarily different) and 
  swap the characters at these indices.

Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal 
  by performing at most one string swap on exactly one of
  the strings. Otherwise, return false.




  

  class Solution {
public:
    bool areAlmostEqual(string s1, string s2) {
    if (s1 == s2) return true; // If already equal, no swap needed
        
        vector<int> diff;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i) {
            if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
                diff.push_back(i);
                if (diff.size() > 2) return false; // More than two differences mean we cannot fix with one swap
            }
        }
        
        return diff.size() == 2 && s1[diff[0]] == s2[diff[1]] && s1[diff[1]] == s2[diff[0]];
    }    
};
