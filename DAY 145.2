Q1. Find Minimum Log Transportation Cost
Solved
Easy
3 pt.
You are given integers n, m, and k.

There are two logs of lengths n and m units, which need to be transported in three trucks where each truck can carry one log with length at most k units.

You may cut the logs into smaller pieces, where the cost of cutting a log of length x into logs of length len1 and len2 is cost = len1 * len2 such that len1 + len2 = x.

Return the minimum total cost to distribute the logs onto the trucks. If the logs don't need to be cut, the total cost is 0.












class Solution {
public:
    long long minCuttingCost(int n, int m, int k) {
        return calculateCost(n, k) + calculateCost(m, k);
    }

private:
    long long calculateCost(int length, int k) {
        if (length <= k) return 0;
        long long L = length;
        long long K = k;
        long long s = (L + K - 1) / K; 
        long long r = L - (s - 1) * K;
        long long sumSquares = (s - 1) * K * K + r * r;
        return (L * L - sumSquares) / 2;
    }
