717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters


We have two special characters:

The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.









class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        const int n=bits.size();
        int i=0;
        for(; i<n-1; i++){
            if(bits[i]==1) i++;
        }
        return i==n-1;
    }
};
