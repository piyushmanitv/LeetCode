Q1. Reverse Degree of a String





Given a string s, calculate its reverse degree.

The reverse degree is calculated as follows:

For each character, multiply its position in the reversed 
alphabet ('a' = 26, 'b' = 25, ..., 'z' = 1) with its position 
in the string (1-indexed).
Sum these products for all characters in the string.
Return the reverse degree of s.










class Solution {
  public:
    int reverseDegree(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            sum += (26 - (s[i] - 'a')) * (i + 1);
        }
        return sum;
    }
