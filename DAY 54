3461. Check If Digits Are Equal in String After Operations I





You are given a string s consisting of digits. Perform the following 
operation repeatedly until the string has exactly two digits:

For each pair of consecutive digits in s, starting from the first digit,
calculate a new digit as the sum of the two digits modulo 10.
Replace s with the sequence of newly calculated digits, maintaining the 
order in which they are computed.
Return true if the final two digits in s are the same; otherwise, return 
false.











class Solution {
public:
    bool hasSameDigits(string s) {
        while (s.size() > 2) {
            string temp;
            for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; ++i) {
                temp += ((s[i] - '0' + s[i + 1] - '0') % 10) + '0';
            }
            s = move(temp); // Efficiently reuse memory
        }
        return s[0] == s[1];
    }
};
