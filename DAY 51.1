38. Count and Say




The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding of countAndSay(n - 1).
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a string compression method that works by replacing 
consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation 
of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the 
run). For example, to compress the string "3322251" we replace "33" with "23", 
replace "222" with "32", replace "5" with "15" and replace "1" with "11". Thus 
the compressed string becomes "23321511".

Given a positive integer n, return the nth element of the count-and-say sequence.







class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
       if(n==1) return "1";
     string str = countAndSay(n-1);
     // str 3322251 -> 23321511
     string ztr="";
      int freq =1;
       char ch =str[0];
     for(int i=1;i<str.length();i++){
         char dh=str[i];
         if(ch==dh){
             freq++;
         }
         else {
             ztr+=(to_string(freq)+ch);
              freq=1;
              ch=dh;
         }
     }
    ztr+=(to_string(freq)+ch);
    return ztr;
    }
};
