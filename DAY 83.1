2390. Removing Stars From a String






You are given a string s, which contains stars *.

In one operation, you can:

Choose a star in s.
Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
Return the string after all stars have been removed.

Note:

The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.






class Solution {
public:
    string removeStars(string s) {
        stack<char> st;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '*' && !st.empty()) {
                st.pop();
            } else {
                st.push(c);
            }
        }
        string ans;
        while (!st.empty()) {
            ans += st.top();
            st.pop();
        }
        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
        return ans;
    }
};
