Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.









class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if (intervals.empty()) return 0;
        sort(intervals.begin(),intervals.end());
        int end=intervals[0][1];
        int c=0;
        for(int i=1;i<intervals.size();i++){
            if(intervals[i][0]<end){
                c++;
                end=min(end,intervals[i][1]);
            }
            else{
                end=intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
