Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).









class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int total = high - low + 1;
        if (low % 2 != 0 && high % 2 != 0) return total / 2 + 1;
        return total / 2;
    }
};
