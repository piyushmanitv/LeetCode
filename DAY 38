3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls





  
You are given an integer limit and a 2D array queries of size n x 2.

There are limit + 1 balls with distinct labels in the range [0, limit]. 
  Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in queries that is 
  of the form [x, y], you mark ball x with the color y. After each query, 
  you need to find the number of distinct colors among the balls.

Return an array result of length n, where result[i] denotes the number of 
  distinct colors after ith query.

Note that when answering a query, lack of a color will not be considered as a color.









  class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> queryResults(int limit, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> answer(queries.size(), 0);
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        unordered_map<int, int> colour;
        int oldCol,newCol;

        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            oldCol = colour[queries[i][0]];
            newCol =  queries[i][1];
            if (oldCol == 0) {
                colour[queries[i][0]] = newCol;
                map[newCol]++;
            } else {
                if (--map[oldCol] == 0)
                    map.erase(oldCol);
                map[newCol]++;
                colour[queries[i][0]] = newCol;
            }
                answer[i] = map.size();
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
