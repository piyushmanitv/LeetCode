Hint
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select an index i and replace nums[i] with nums[i] - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array divisible by k.
















class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum % k;
    }
};
