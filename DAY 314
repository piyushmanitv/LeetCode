3542. Minimum Operations to Convert All Elements to Zero


You are given an array nums of size n, consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to apply some (possibly zero) operations on the array so that all elements become 0.

In one operation, you can select a subarray [i, j] (where 0 <= i <= j < n) and set all occurrences of the minimum non-negative integer in that subarray to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array 0.












constexpr int N=1e5;
int st[N], top=-1;
class Solution {
public:
    static int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        top=-1;
        int op=0;
        for (int x : nums){
            while(top!=-1 && x<st[top]) top--;
            if (top==-1 || x>st[top]){
                if (x>0) op++;
                st[++top]=x;
            }
        }
        return op;
    }
};
