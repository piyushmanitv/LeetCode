2894. Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference


You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
Return the integer num1 - num2.











class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int divisibleCount = n / m;
        int divisibleSum = m * divisibleCount * (divisibleCount + 1) / 2;
        return totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum;
    }
};
