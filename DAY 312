Hint
Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:

Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.
Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.









class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        int res;
        for (res = 0; n > 0; n &= n - 1)
            res = -(res + (n ^ (n - 1)));
        return abs(res);
    }
};
