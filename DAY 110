781. Rabbits in Forest





There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same 
color as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.

Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.










class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& nums, int total = 0) {
        unordered_map <int,int> mpp;
        for (int i : nums) mpp[i]++;
        for (auto& p : mpp)
        total += ceil((double)p.second / (p.first + 1)) * (p.first + 1);
        return total;
    }
};
