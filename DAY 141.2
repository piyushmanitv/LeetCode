Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {

        unordered_map<char, char> t_to_s;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c1 = s[i];
            char c2 = t[i];

            if (s_to_t.count(c1)) {
                if (s_to_t[c1] != c2) return false;
            } else {
                s_to_t[c1] = c2;
            }

            if (t_to_s.count(c2)) {
                if (t_to_s[c2] != c1) return false;
            } else {
                t_to_s[c2] = c1;
