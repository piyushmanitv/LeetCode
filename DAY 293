2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations


There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.









class Solution {
public:
    int finalValueAfterOperations(vector<string>& operations) {
        int n = operations.size();
        int x = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            bool found = operations[i].find("+") != string::npos;
            if (found) x++;
            else x--;
        }
        return x;
    }
};
