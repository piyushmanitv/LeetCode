Hint
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.


















class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int n = text1.size(), m = text2.size();
        vector<int> dp(m + 1, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int prev = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                int temp = dp[j + 1];
                if (text1[i] == text2[j]) {
                    dp[j + 1] = prev + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[j + 1] = max(dp[j + 1], dp[j]);
                }
                prev = temp;
            }
        }
        return dp[m];
    }
};
