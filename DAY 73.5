123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III




You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again)










class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
     int n = prices.size(), i, buy1 = INT_MAX, profit1 = 0, buy2 = INT_MAX, profit2 = 0;

        for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            buy1 = min(buy1, prices[i]);
            profit1 = max(profit1, prices[i] - buy1);
            buy2 = min(buy2, prices[i] - profit1);
            profit2 = max(profit2, prices[i] - buy2);
        }

        return profit2;   
    }
};
