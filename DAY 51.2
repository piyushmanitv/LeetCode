200. Number of Islands





Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map 
of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting 
adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all 
four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
