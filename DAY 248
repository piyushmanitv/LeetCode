Hint
You are given two integers num1 and num2.

In one operation, you can choose integer i in the range [0, 60] and subtract 2i + num2 from num1.

Return the integer denoting the minimum number of operations needed to make num1 equal to 0.

If it is impossible to make num1 equal to 0, return -1.








class Solution {
public:
    int makeTheIntegerZero(int num1, int num2) {
        for(int operationCount = 1; operationCount <= 32; operationCount++){
            long long left = (1LL * num1) - (1LL * operationCount * num2);
            if(left < operationCount) return -1;
            int b = __builtin_popcountll(left);
            if(operationCount >= b) return operationCount;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
