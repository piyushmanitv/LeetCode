A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.











class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max = INT_MIN;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]>max) max=nums[i];
        }
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]==max) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
