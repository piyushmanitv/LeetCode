1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank


Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.

Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.










class Solution {
public:
     int totalMoney(int n) {
        int t1=n/7,t2=n%7;
        double ans=((double)t1/2)*(2*28+(t1-1)*7); 
        ans+=((double)t2/2)*(2*(t1+1)+(t2-1)*1);
        return (int)ans;
    }
};
