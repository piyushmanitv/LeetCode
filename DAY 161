3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I


You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.












class Solution {
public:
    int maxDifference(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        int odd = 0;
        int even = s.length();
        for (int n : freq) {
            if (n % 2 == 1) {
                odd = max(odd, n);
            } else if (n != 0) {
                even = min(even, n);
            }
        }
        return odd - even;
    }
};
